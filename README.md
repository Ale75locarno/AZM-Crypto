# AZM-Crypto
A new app with an attached platform and its own crypto, capable of converting all the crypto to BTC and immediately into a FIAT coin
The main project is to create an app that manages to associate 100 cryptocurrencies among the most quoted and known in the world. Through an algorithm it would be possible to know their value instantly, and therefore the exchange value would be immediately accessible. The crypto with the payment of a fee would be converted into fiat currency and through a payment system with QRCODE. With MASTERCARD channels. Obviously, the merchant would receive his currency quickly and instantaneously using the convectional or banking method.

Obviously the same app would also have its currency just the AZM Crypto, the initial value of this Token would be 1 $ with an available quantity of 50 Ml of coins. Upon payment of the Fee, 30% of the commission paid would be to consume the remaining value of the currency, creating its shortage and therefore the increasing value of the currency.

70% of the fee would go to the WALLET of the DAO that created the Token itself, the AZM token and still under development and would be supported on the ethereum blockchain. It is also foreseen the dissemination and the realization of a community that marries the same project and the currency by purchasing MINING packages connected to the Ethereum and BTC blockchain. At the start of D.A.O and ICO the value of each Token would be $ 1. In the time necessary for the creation of the definitive platform and the app connected to the platform we could start with the sale of the currency (AZM Crypto) by taking advantage of the companies of MINING in this way we would create an initial shortage of the crypto and we would have the possibility to pay the fees of the prof. off-work you have miners who would marry the project. The packages would be to be viewed and evaluated, but would start from a base accessible to all with a minimum cost of $ 50 to an initial maximum of $ 5000.

At the start of the new app the fees of the fees due to the D.A.O with the project participants could be divided into the following formula

example

30% coin shortage
25% to the participant who would be associated with the causal customer owner of the app and a crypto or AZM Crypto
45% of the fee to the D.A.O.

All would benefit from this and disclosure could also be made in the form of Marketing following agreements with mining companies or mining and machinery rental companies

the blockchain chosen for the use of the crypto would always be connected to Ethereum
